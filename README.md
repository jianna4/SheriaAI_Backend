# SHERIA_AI Backend

This is the backend for **SHERIA_AI**, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to help users understand **Kenyan labor laws** through a familiar interface ‚Äî **WhatsApp**.  
The system retrieves relevant legal information and generates natural, conversational answers that can be easily accessed by both employees and employers.

---
## üí° Problem Statement

Access to legal information in Kenya remains limited due to:
- Complex legal language in acts and regulations  
- Limited public awareness of labor rights  
- Inaccessibility of legal resources to the general public 
There is legal information but certainly a better way to deliver it to users. 

**Sheria_AI** bridges this gap by offering a simple, conversational interface where users can ask questions in plain language and receive accurate, law-based answers.

## üéØ Objectives

1. Develop a **RAG-based backend** capable of retrieving and interpreting Kenyan labor laws.  
2. Provide a **WhatsApp interface** for natural language interaction.  
3. Implement a **vectorized knowledge base** from verified legal sources.  
4. Enable easy **scalability** to other domains such as criminal, land, or family law.

## üöÄ Overview

SHERIA_AI aims to make legal information, particularly **employment and labor rights**, more accessible to everyday users.  
Users interact with the system via **WhatsApp**, where they can ask questions such as:

> ‚ÄúWhat are my rights as an employee during termination?‚Äù  
> ‚ÄúCan my employer reduce my salary without notice?‚Äù

## Data Sources
The data comes directly from the labour regulations act of kenya.This is a legible source ensuring correct information to the users.
