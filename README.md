# ‚öñÔ∏è LawBot Backend ‚Äì RAG-Powered Legal Assistant

This is the backend for **LawBot**, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to help users understand **Kenyan labor laws** through a familiar interface ‚Äî **WhatsApp**.  
The system retrieves relevant legal information and generates natural, conversational answers that can be easily accessed by both employees and employers.

---

## üöÄ Overview

LawBot aims to make legal information, particularly **employment and labor rights**, more accessible to everyday users.  
Users interact with the system via **WhatsApp**, where they can ask questions such as:

> ‚ÄúWhat are my rights as an employee during termination?‚Äù  
> ‚ÄúCan my employer reduce my salary without notice?‚Äù

The backend handles:

- Law data ingestion and processing (PDFs, legal documents, etc.)
- Text embedding and vector storage
- Query retrieval using semantic search
- Response generation using a language model
- WhatsApp API communication (via Twilio or similar)
